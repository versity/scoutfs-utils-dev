.SH NAME
scoutfs \- overview and mount options for the scoutfs filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
A scoutfs filesystem is stored on two block devices.  Multiple mounts of
the filesystem are supported between hosts that share access to the
block device.  A new filesystem is created with the
.B mkfs
command in the
.BR scoutfs (8)
utility.
.SH MOUNT OPTIONS
The following mount options are supported by scoutfs in addition to the
general mount options described in the
.BR mount (8)
manual page.
.TP
.B metadev_path=<device>
The metadev_path option specifies the path to the block device that
contains the filesystem's metadata.
.sp
This option is required.
.TP
.B server_addr=<ipv4:port>
The server_addr option indicates that this mount will participate in
quorum election to try and run a server for all the mounts of its
filesystem.   The option specifies the local TCP IPv4 address that the
mount's elected server will listen on for connections from all other
mounts of the filesystem.
.sp
The IPv4 address must be specified as a dotted quad, name resolution is
not supported.  A specific port may be provided after a seperating
colon.  If no port is specified then a random port will be chosen.  The
address will be used for the lifetime of the mount and can not be
changed.  The mount must be unmounted to specify a different address.
.sp
If server_addr is not specified then the mount will read the filesystem
until it sees the address of an elected server to connect to.
.SH FURTHER READING
A
.B scoutfs
filesystem can detect corruption at runtime.  A catalog of kernel log
messages that indicate corruption can be found in
.BR scoutfs-corruption (8)
\&.
